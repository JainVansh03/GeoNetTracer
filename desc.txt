Developed GeoNetTracer, a Python-based network traffic visualization tool that brings network data to life by mapping traffic flows on Google Maps. This project extracts and analyzes network traffic from Wireshark captures, maps IP addresses to real-world locations using the GeoLiteCity database, and generates KML files for seamless integration with Google Maps. The tool features personalized map visuals with customizable line styles, offering an intuitive platform to optimize network security and performance by identifying global data flows and potential security risks.
